    abstract = {The k-SAT problem is to determine if a given k-CNF has a satisfying assignment. It is a celebrated open question as to whether it requires exponential time to solve k-SAT for k⩾3. Here exponential time means 2δn for some δ>0. In this paper, assuming that, for k⩾3, k-SAT requires exponential time complexity, we show that the complexity of k-SAT increases as k increases. More precisely, for k⩾3, define sk=inf{δ:there exists 2δn algorithm for solving k-SAT}. Define ETH (Exponential-Time Hypothesis) for k-SAT as follows: for k⩾3, sk>0. In this paper, we show that sk is increasing infinitely often assuming ETH for k-SAT. Let s∞ be the limit of sk. We will in fact show that sk⩽(1−d/k)s∞ for some constant d>0. We prove this result by bringing together the ideas of critical clauses and the Sparsification Lemma to reduce the satisfiability of a k-CNF to the satisfiability of a disjunction of 2εnk′-CNFs in fewer variables for some k′⩾k and arbitrarily small ε>0. We also show that such a disjunction can be computed in time 2εn for arbitrarily small ε>0.}

    abstract = {The field of exact exponential time algorithms for non-deterministic polynomial-time
    hard problems has thrived since the mid-2000s. While exhaustive search remains asymptotically
    the fastest known algorithm for some basic problems, non-trivial exponential time
    algorithms have been found for a myriad of problems, including Graph Coloring, Hamiltonian
    Path, Dominating Set, and 3-CNF-Sat. In some instances, improving these algorithms
    further seems to be out of reach. The CNF-Sat problem is the canonical example of
    a problem for which the trivial exhaustive search algorithm runs in time O(2n), where
    n is the number of variables in the input formula. While there exist non-trivial algorithms
    for CNF-Sat that run in time o(2n), no algorithm was able to improve the growth rate
    2 to a smaller constant, and hence it is natural to conjecture that 2 is the optimal
    growth rate. The strong exponential time hypothesis (SETH) by Impagliazzo and Paturi
    [JCSS 2001] goes a little bit further and asserts that, for every ϵ &lt; 1, there is
    a (large) integer k such that k-CNF-Sat cannot be computed in time 2ϵn.In this article,
    we show that, for every ϵ &lt; 1, the problems Hitting Set, Set Splitting, and NAE-Sat
    cannot be computed in time O(2ϵn) unless SETH fails. Here n is the number of elements
    or variables in the input. For these problems, we actually get an equivalence to SETH
    in a certain sense. We conjecture that SETH implies a similar statement for Set Cover
    and prove that, under this assumption, the fastest known algorithms for Steiner Tree,
    Connected Vertex Cover, Set Partitioning, and the pseudo-polynomial time algorithm
    for Subset Sum cannot be significantly improved. Finally, we justify our assumption
    about the hardness of Set Cover by showing that the parity of the number of solutions
    to Set Cover cannot be computed in time O(2ϵn) for any ϵ &lt; 1 unless SETH fails.},

    abstract = {It is widely believed that showing a problem to be NP-complete is tantamount to proving its computational intractability. In this paper we show that a number of NP-complete problems remain NP-complete even when their domains are substantially restricted. First we show the completeness of SIMPLE MAX CUT (MAX CUT with edge weights restricted to value 1), and, as a corollary, the completeness of the OPTIMAL LINEAR ARRANGEMENT problem. We then show that even if the domains of the NODE COVER and DIRECTED HAMILTONIAN PATH problems are restricted to planar graphs, the two problems remain NP-complete, and that these and other graph problems remain NP-complete even when their domains are restricted to graphs with low node degrees. For GRAPH 3-COLORABILITY, NODE COVER, and UNDIRECTED HAMILTONIAN CIRCUIT, we determine essentially the lowest possible upper bounds on node degree for which the problems remain NP-complete.},

We also show an exponential-time reduction from Graph Homomorphism to Subgraph Isomorphism. This rules out (subject to ETH) a possibility of |V(H)|o(|V(H)|)-time algorithm deciding if graph G is a subgraph of H. For both problems our lower bounds asymptotically match the running time of brute-force algorithms trying all possible mappings of one graph into another. Thus, our work closes the gap in the known complexity of these fundamental problems.Moreover, as a consequence of our reductions, conditional lower bounds follow for other related problems such as Locally Injective Homomorphism, Graph Minors, Topological Graph Minors, Minimum Distortion Embedding and Quadratic Assignment Problem.},

It is reasonable to consider such a problem satisfactorily solved when an algorithm for its solution is found which terminates within a number of steps bounded by a polynomial in the length of the input. We show that a large number of classic unsolved problems of covering, matching, packing, routing, assignment and sequencing are equivalent, in the sense that either each of them possesses a polynomial-bounded algorithm or none of them does.",
